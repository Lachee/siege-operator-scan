# siege-operator-scan
Scans for operators based off a screenshot

SiegeOperatorDigest does the fetching from OBS, Cropping and Uploading
SiegeOperatorCompare is what the server runs to process the image
The other folder is old news. 

OBS Requires this particular one: https://github.com/Lachee/obs-frame-capture-filter
I have included a build of it in this repo, but it might not be upto date.
